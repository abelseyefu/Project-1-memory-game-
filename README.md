PROBLEMS: I could not use a timer like originally planned due to the facte that my game logic runs depending on the clicking of the user. When the user clicks twice to select two cards, is when the game starts and the logic starts, but the game logic resets after two clicks thus inidvertantly, reseting the timer. to get past this problem I went with a score incrementation to diaplay each attempt the user tried to match all the pairs.
